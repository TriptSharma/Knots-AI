Robotic manipulators have emerged as a crucial technology in the industries to automate the manufacturing, material handling,and transfer applications. The large size and confined workspace restricted their application domains to specific domains. Many of the past works have a confined work volume with lower degrees of autonomy. In this project, we aim to develop a mobile manipulator to extend the workspace of a 6R robotic manipulator. The differential-drive vehicle will be equipped with odometry and LIDAR sensors for the purpose of object avoidance, navigation, and localization. A five DoF robotic manipulator will be placed on a rotatable platform and hence six DoF can be achieved. To create a more general-purpose and versatile bot, an ML model is trained for object detection. Thus, a broad category of objects can be picked or moved in a dynamic environment with the help of the arm, aided by a stereo-camera. Furthermore, the bot has the ability to interact with the surrounding on more higher and abstract level because of the speech recognition module. Thereby, enhancing human-computer interactions in a real-time dynamic environment. Hence, VOLEY is a state-of-the-art autonomous 6-DoF general-purpose robot with speech interface.
